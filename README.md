## [Job Tracker](https://door2door.build/)

*Job Tracker* is an app dedicated to optimizing the workflow of *Door2Door Builder Services, LLC*, a subcontracting business in the construction industry dedicated to providing a variety of installation services to builders in remodeling and new construction. 

Prior to the development of *Job Tracker*, the owners would track the status of individual jobs through multiple medium: digital spreadsheets, jots on a notepad, and even memory. Although each medium is effective in isolation, its efficacy is lost when the jobs to track are spread throughout all three methods, resulting in inconsistencies and miscommunication amongst the owners.

*Job Tracker* allows the owners to track all of their jobs in one place, having the ability to update the status of each job throughout the construction process.

In addition, this app allows employees to access information regarding the job they are working on, such as its address, its method of access, or the builder directing that job.

Employees may also add a work log to an individual job, providing a record to the owners of the work they had done. These work logs are later used to do payroll.
